## **Async API**

This module simplifies the triggering of long-running processes by creating RESTful APIâ€™s that manage and trigger the
processes.

Since this is a MVP , the configurations and backends are simplified. Scalibilty and optimaztions are discussed further.

- The jobs and groups info is stored in `resources/config.yaml`. The group and jobs are defined as follows
    - One group can have multiple jobs
    - A job represents a long-running process.A long-running process can be system sleep / logging and it may intermittently run
forever to simulate a system failure.
      
####**Functionality**
-   Endpoint to trigger a group. `/group/<group_name>`
-   Once a group action is triggered, simulate the background process that runs all of
the jobs within that group.
-   The long-running process status can be tracked via endpoint `/status/<job_id>`

The API flow is well depicted in the following diagram

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have `Docker` installed on the host computer to run and test the application
2. port `5100` is available for rest api
3. port `6379` is available for redis backend

### Setup

#### Building the docker file

Go to the root folder of the project and execute

` docker build .`

This will start building docker images for _redis_ , _flask_ and _celery_

` docker-compose up -d`

The above command should start docker process.

### Use

**Trigger Group**

Enter the following URL `http://localhost:5100/group/group_a` , this will trigger all the jobs under group_a.
The following groups and jobs are configured. please refer to `resources/config.yaml` for more details
    
    -   [Valid] "group_a"  with [Valid] jobs and definition "job_a1" , "job_a2" and "job_a3"
    -   [Valid] "group_b"  with  jobs and [InValid] definition "job_b1" , "job_b2" and "job_b3"
    -   [Valid] "group_c"  with [InValid]  no jobs and [InValid] 

A valid request `http://localhost:5100/group/group_a` should return url for tracking the child jobs in the following format

`{"Check job status at":["/status/78b988f6-87d9-4225-86b5-cabe6e475102","/status/a9f27bc0-e4c1-49d8-9818-851e1388e590","/status/05cd046a-7a20-4711-9dd0-b57cf1028135"]}`


**Check Job Status **

Enter the following URL `http://localhost:5100/status/<job_id>` , this return the job status

Valid Response :

`{"state":"SUCCESS","task_id":"78b988f6-87d9-4225-86b5-cabe6e475102"}`

Invalid Response :

`Job with given id doesn't exists : dummy`
